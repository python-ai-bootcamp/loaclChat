    sdk: flutter

  flutter_blue_plus_windows: ^1.0.0
  # flutter_ble_peripheral: ^2.0.0
  # NOTE: Disabled due to DLL crash on Windows (segfault 0xc0000005) when no Bluetooth hardware is present.
  # The plugin DLL loads during Flutter's plugin registration phase (before Dart code runs),
  # causing a crash if Bluetooth hardware is not available.
  # The app now checks for Bluetooth availability early and shows a graceful error page.
  # Advertising is disabled on Windows - users can scan but not advertise.
  # To re-enable: uncomment the line above and rebuild. May still crash if no Bluetooth hardware.
